# IrisRadiusDetection

Goal: To detect the iris of an human eye and find its radius in real time.

Progress:  

03/03/22: Googled about OpenCV and tried to execute the example program given in the geeksforgeeks website but looks like code is full of bugs and decided not to use that as reference .

04/03/22: Nothing

05/03/22: Found a tutorial on youtube about OpenCV and started watching the video.

06/03/22: Half way into the tutotial. 
          Made a simple program to detect basic shapes as a practice. 
          Started the project. 
          Successfully able to output the image and still struggling with basic level image processing.
          Learning about Thresholding and Canny functions.

07/03/22: Completed the tutorial and learning contoures for more possible information.
          Image processing is still on progress. .
          Grayscaling and Thresholding the image went succesfully but far from completion.
          Finding difficulty in cropping the iris from the image.
    
08/03/22: Endlessly searching for forums to get some help.
          Found a blogpost on how to crop an image from an image using OpenCV.
          Deployed the same method and was successful and got the output.
          Creating various methods/functions and ordered them to create the program logic.
          The program to detect Iris and crop the image was successful but still needs refining.

09/03/22: Still cant find a way to calculate the obtained area of pixels into real time area of iris.
          Code Clean-up
          GitHub Repo was set up for view.
          Looking through online forums and research papers to find a better suiting algorithm to detect the radius of iris.
          Learning about Otzu algorithm, Flooding algorithm and Sobel Algortihm.
